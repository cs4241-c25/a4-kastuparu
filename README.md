The goal of the application is to create and store tasks (task name, priority, and due date) which are associated with a user's account. I used the GitHub Passport Strategy for authentication, MongoDB for the database, ExpressJS in the backend, ReactJS in the frontend, and the MaterialUI framework for styling. The main difference from my Assignment 3 was adding ReactJS in the frontend and changing from Bootstrap to MaterialUI.
